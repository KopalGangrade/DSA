# Bubble Sort
# It is a comparison-based algorithm in which each pair of adjacent elements is compared and the elements are swapped if they are not in order.

# Example
# def bubblesort(list):

# # Swap the elements to arrange in order
#    for iter_num in range(len(list)-1,0,-1):
#       for idx in range(iter_num):
#          if list[idx]>list[idx+1]:
#             temp = list[idx]
#             list[idx] = list[idx+1]
#             list[idx+1] = temp
# list = [19,2,31,45,6,11,121,27]
# bubblesort(list)
# print(list)
# Output
# When the above code is executed, it produces the following result âˆ’

# [2, 6, 11, 19, 27, 31, 45, 121]





# bubble sorting example


# arr = [9, 7, 3, 1, 8, 4, 12, 6]
# n = len(arr)
# for i in range(n - 1):
#     for j in range(n - i - 1):
#         if arr[j] >arr[j + 1]:
#             temp = arr[j]
#             arr[j] = arr[j + 1]
#             arr[j + 1] = temp
# print(arr)
